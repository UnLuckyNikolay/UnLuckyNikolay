## Hi, I'm Nikolay 👋

I'm a self-taught developer and [3D artist](https://www.artstation.com/unluckynikolay) looking for my first role as a **Junior Software Developer** or **QA Tester**. 

I enjoy building things and making them better - most of my projects started simple and grew as I learned new techniques.

My ultimate goal is to learn how to build games and useful software "from scratch" (without inventing [the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkHCO8f2TWs)).

Currently learning through Boot.dev and working on personal projects in **Python**, **Go**, and **C#**.
